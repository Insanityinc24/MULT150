  1. Is the game too easy or hard? 
It's easy but the controls kind of suck so most of the time the balls go into the goal by theirselves.

  2.What would make it easier or harder?
If the balls only go in the hole if you directly push them with no ricochets would make it harder but if the controls were less floatly it would make this easier at the sametime.

  3. What would give it a “wow” factor?
Adding some sound effects when you score the goal and more environmental chamges to really bring out the colors and give it an arcade feel.

  4.What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
The bouncy balls are a fun dynamic and it reminds me of airhockey but you're inside of the rink. The controls are tedious where it makes the game very un-fun.

  Suggestions from exercise
1.Try changing the size or shape of the player’s bumper.I changed the bumpers size to be taller
2.Try making a complex bumper out of many shapes. I added complex bumper out of many shapes : I created BumperMan
3.Try adding variations of the chaos balls. I added variety to the Chaos ball by changing speed and freezing more axis' on some
4.Try changing the footsteps audio to something that makes more sense with the water.I created a Footstep Script to make it sound like the character was walking in water.
