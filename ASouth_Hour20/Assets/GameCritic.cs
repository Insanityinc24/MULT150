1. Is the game too easy or hard? 
Not really I found it very easy to keep the game going.

2. What changes would you do to make it easier or harder? 
Maybe make more of a penalty if you hit the obstacle to slow you down longer or as you progress make the penalty much larger depending on how much time has elapsed.

3. What would make the game more appealing?
I think cop out answer is always sound and visuals for me but gameplay wise I would add a little story to it and just a reason why you are running the first place or simply a title screen.

4. What parts of the game are fun? 
I really like the based idea of this game of just running and surviving I think the overall concept of surviving is funny and could be addicting.

5. What parts of the game are tedious?
Not really much is tedious but maybe size and brightness of the object are distracting for me and maybe I would change the intensity of it to be able to see the game better.

Obstacle Changes
Make it into a flying astroid with flames.

There is going to be a lot of Starbit Prefabs I was having trouble getting it to work and it only worked if I had mutiple Prefabs.
The particles for the Powerup changes were made to make it more falling star like.
