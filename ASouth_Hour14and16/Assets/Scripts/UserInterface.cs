/* Made my UI into a title screen for a made up game named Monkey Business. 
 * Changes I made were I change background image to a chimp in a suit, made the background color red for grungy look, made the title of the a gradient yellow/brown to give it that banana look to the word, made a cool opening sentence to make the game more dramatic and made the start point labeled "Go Bananas" and it turns to red and spells out a sound a chimp makes.
